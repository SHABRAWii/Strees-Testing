Stress-Testing is a project that ensures the ability of a program to work correctly under predefined conditions. 

it is used mostly in competitive programming and developing algorithms.

# Basic Overview

>**The General Problem most of programmers face** 
><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  when they **create** an **algorithm** to **solve** specific **issue** they are **not sure** that this algorithm **works correctly** for all cases that may happen.

>**Now comes our solution.** 
><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  We can create **brute force code** that work **very slow** and give him big number of **test cases** and **compare its output** with our **algorithm output** and see **if** it **passes** all these test cases.

# Features

  * You don't have to **create Code to Generate** random **test cases** at all.
  * **Test Cases** are **Generated** by **given generator as you like**. ( Saves more time in working )
  * **Random** Test Cases are generated using **uniformly distribution generators**.
  * Available Languages : **C++, Java, Python**.
  * You can Strees test **2 Codes** with **different languages**.
  * **Overflows** and **sigmantation fault** and **compilation error** are detected and the program returns useful **message** to **help** you **fix the issue**.
  * **Time Limit Exceeded** for the WA code ( **the algorithm** ) are detected and the program returns **Time Limit Exceeded**.
  * **Time Limit Exceeded** for the AC code ( **the bruteforce** ) are detected and the program returns **AC Time Limit Exceeded** to tell you that the **brute force** are **too slow to run**.
  * **Files** that are **only used** and **only have changes** are the ones who are **only compiled again** otherwise the program runs. ( Saves more time in working )
  * **Running Time** of the WA code ( **the algorithm** ) are being **measured** to tell you the **average running time** of **the algorithm**.
  * The **program** are **highlited** to be **comfortable** for the user.

# Limitations

  * Only **C++, Python** and **Java** are available to use till now!.
  * **Predefined test cases** that have **special properties** must get their **own generator written from scratch**.
  * **Memory** of the running **algorithm** are **not** being **measured**.

# Getting Started
&nbsp; Get **local copy** of the project on your PC.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SHABRAWii/Strees-Testing.git
```
&nbsp; If you are using **Windows** make sure you have **bash** installed. For me when I have **Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL)** so I **can** use **bash**.
```bash
chmod +x init.sh         # make init.sh file excutable
./init.sh                # run init.sh and type your (WSL) password and it will install all requirements
```
